# Fetching data with Material UI

This example allow you to fetch data from api get news from `techcrunch` using api service: [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/). 

In this example, I use:
+ babel config
+ postCSS config
+ webpack config: to add plugins allow develop CSS using SCSS
+ using Redux
+ using Material UI
+ using custom Document
+ custom Routes
+ Data fetching
+ gulp

Basically, Next.JS allow you to use `style-jsx` package to develop CSS, but in the production mode, html is not minified. So that, gulp allow you to bundle final all scss into css.

## How to use

Install it and run:

# development

```bash
npm i nodemon -g
